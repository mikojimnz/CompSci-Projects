      The original PictureLab Case Study was moved into this package and additional functionality was added.
<p>
    A number of methods for manipulating images at the pixel level are available in the Pixel class. Pixels and Pictures are NOT immutable,
    so the object itself can be modified by various methods in the <tt>Picture</tt> class. In addition to the methods in Picture, other methods
    to manipulate and create images are found in the <tt>CollageMaker</tt> and <tt>PictureUtils</tt> classes.
